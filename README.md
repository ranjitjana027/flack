# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
"#flackweb" 

## Objectives
Learn to use JavaScript to run code server-side.
Become more comfortable with building web user interfaces.
Gain experience with Socket.IO to communicate between clients and servers.
##Overview
In this project, I've built an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users
will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to
communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will
be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.
